                When you stepped off the boat and placed your feet upon this
                island, you crossed a threshold.
                <br />
                Behind you, the world kept spinning in its endless rhythm.
                <br />
                Here, the rhythm slows.

                For six days, this island is not simply a place.
                <br />
                It is a world within a world.

                <br />
                They are planted as seeds of trust.
                <br />
                They live only in the hearts of those who were here to witness.

                We meet one another barefoot, at the table, by the fire, beneath
                the stars.

                We walk gently. We care deeply. We leave no trace but our songs.

                We sing with voices raw beneath the moon.
