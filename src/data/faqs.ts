    question: "Why Project Sanctuary?",
    answer:
      "We’re creating something rare—a space where presence, connection, and creativity thrive without external noise. This isn’t just a party—it’s a container for exploration, play, and deep authenticity. Everything we do is about making sure you feel safe to show up fully, just as you are.",
  },
  {
    question: "Privacy and Phones?",
    answer:
      "**Privacy is sacred.**\n\nWe ask that you keep phones tucked away as much as possible. No social media posting, no livestreaming, no content creation during the event. This is a space to be here now, not perform online.\n\nLet’s reclaim the moment, the dance floor, and the magic that only happens when no one’s watching.",
  },
  {
    question: "Confidentiality",
    answer:
      "**What happens here, stays here.**\n\nThis is a private event in a private space. Please do not share attendee names, stories, or photos without explicit consent. We trust our community to hold these boundaries with integrity.\n\nEvery interaction is built on respect, presence, and mutual trust.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who can attend?",
    answer:
      "Access is intentionally limited. Everyone attending must complete the membership interview process. This helps ensure we’re aligned in values and in how we show up for one another.\n\nThis isn’t about status or social clout—it’s about spirit, energy, and intention.",
  },
  {
    question: "What’s Included?",
    answer:
      "All meals, drinks, lodging (if you hold a castle ticket), entertainment, and shuttles from neighboring hotels are included.\n\nMore than that: you’ll be part of an unforgettable experience, surrounded by humans who are here to co-create something beautiful together.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I prepare?",
    answer:
      "Come as you are, but consider arriving with:\n- **An open heart** ❤️\n- **A curious mind** 🤲\n- **A grounded presence** 🌱\n\nYou don’t need to bring much—just a willingness to disconnect from the outside world and drop into something meaningful and real.",
  },
  {
    question: "Refund Policy",
