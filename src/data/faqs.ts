    question: "About the island",
    answer:
      'Where is Obonjan?\n Obonjan is a small island about 6 kilometers off the coast of Šibenik, Croatia, in the Adriatic Sea. It is known for its pine forests, clear waters, and stone beaches.\n\nHistory of Obonjan\n Obonjan has been inhabited and repurposed many times across centuries.\nIn earlier centuries it was a quiet fishing and farming island for local communities.\n\nIn the 1970s, it was developed as a youth scout camp and became known internationally as the "Island of Youth," hosting visitors from across Europe.\n\nAfter years of dormancy, the island was reimagined in the mid-2010s as a resort destination with a focus on wellness, music, and sustainable tourism.\n\nToday, Obonjan operates seasonally with accommodations, wellness spaces, and activity infrastructure, while preserving much of its natural landscape.\n\nFor PAN Croatia 2026, Obonjan will again transform — into a temporary sanctuary shaped by inclusivity with discernment.',
