            The fact that <strong>Eelke Kleijn</strong> DJs in his socks and
            produces in a standing position tells you exactly what you need to
            know about him.
            <br />
            <br />
            He never feels more at home than when he's behind the decks, and
            there's no separation between the booth, his studio or the dance
            floor.
            <br />
            <br />
            This <em>natural air</em> he brings to all facets of his music is
            reflected in its <em>organic feel</em> and has helped his{" "}
            <strong>creative identity shine</strong> in a crowded scene.

            made the jump into the wider world when the time and opportunity
            felt right.

            <em>without giving up on his core values</em>.<br />
            <br />
            Recent success has also come in the form of{" "}
            <strong>'Transmission'</strong>, with both the original version and{" "}
            <strong>Joris Voorn's remix</strong> fully living up to their
            potential across <strong>DJ sets</strong>,{" "}
