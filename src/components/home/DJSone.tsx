            <strong>Sone</strong> is the only <strong>pop singer</strong> of her
            generation that has the <strong>voice</strong>,{" "}
            <strong>technique</strong> and <strong>power</strong> to sing over
            an orchestra and dominate an opera stage.
            <br />
            <br />
            She has the ability to balance <strong>
              vocal power
            </strong> with <em>vulnerability</em> both onstage and in the
            studio; she does the same with her lyrics, unafraid to share a piece
            of herself through each song.
            <br />
            <br />
            Sone is able to control her voice in a way that has a{" "}

            <strong>Popera</strong>.
