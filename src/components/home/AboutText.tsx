        <h3 className="mb-2 text-2xl font-semibold italic">What is Pan?</h3>
        <p className="not-italic leading-relaxed text-gray-800">
          Pan, the Greek god of the wild, is closely linked to music through his
          creation of the pan flute (or syrinx), fashioned from reeds that were
          once the nymph Syrinx.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 not-italic leading-relaxed text-gray-800">
          His music is earthy and instinctive‚Äîless refined than Apollo‚Äôs, but
          charged with emotion and spontaneity. Heard drifting through forests
          and fields, his melodies could enchant animals, and even spark
          dancing.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 not-italic leading-relaxed text-gray-800">
          So in a musical sense, Pan embodies the untamed, primal side of
          music‚Äîa direct channel to nature, feeling, and freedom.
