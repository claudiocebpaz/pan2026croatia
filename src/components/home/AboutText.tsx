        Project Sanctuary Presents... Early Bird Prelaunch!
      </h2>
      <p className="font-quattrocento mt-6 text-xl/8">
        For six unforgettable days, Obonjan Island belongs entirely to us‚Äîan
        intimate sanctuary in Croatia where every moment is curated to celebrate
        presence, deep human connection, and the joy of unbridled freedom.
      </p>
      <p className="font-inter mt-6 text-lg/8 font-medium">
        From May 19 to May 25, 2026, the island is ours. Obonjan transforms into
        a playground of
        <span className="font-semibold text-yellow-600">
          {" "}
          music, movement, and epic performances
        </span>
        from world-class artists across every modality. Rituals of connection
        meet long table feasts, poolside mischief, and late-night adventures
        that blur the line between festival and family. This is Pan, a living
        experiment in what happens when strangers step off the grid and into
        something real.
      </p>

      <p className="font-inter mt-6 text-lg/8 font-medium">
        Project Sanctuary is not a club, it is a frequency. Here we reclaim
        <span className="font-semibold text-yellow-600">
          {" "}
          dance floors as sacred ground
        </span>{" "}
        and conversation as art. Phones stay in pockets. There are no
        spectators, no performances for the outside world‚Äî only the magic of
        being fully here.
      </p>

        <p className="text-lg/8 font-medium italic text-gray-800">
          And the schedule is only a foundation. Every day and every night the
          island will surprise you. A hidden performance, a sunrise ceremony, a
          pop-up jam, a secret gathering in the forest‚Äî some you may stumble
          upon alone, others will pull the whole community into one electric
          heartbeat.

        <h3 className="mb-2 text-2xl font-semibold italic">What is Pan?</h3>
        <p className="not-italic leading-relaxed text-gray-800">
          Pan, the Greek god of the wild, is closely linked to music through his
          creation of the pan flute (or syrinx), fashioned from reeds that were
          once the nymph Syrinx.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 not-italic leading-relaxed text-gray-800">
          His music is earthy and instinctive, less refined than Apollo‚Äôs but
          charged with emotion and spontaneity. Heard drifting through forests
          and fields, his melodies could enchant animals, and even spark
          dancing.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 not-italic leading-relaxed text-gray-800">
          So in a musical sense, Pan embodies the untamed, primal side of music,
          a direct channel to nature, feeling, and freedom.
