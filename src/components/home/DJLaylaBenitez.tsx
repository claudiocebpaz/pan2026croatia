            <strong>Layla Benitez</strong> may have been in DJ booths since she
            was barely old enough to walk, but her DJing and production reveal
            an artist who continues to evolve and grow with every gig and every
            experience.
            <br />
            <br />
            Her August 2021 <strong>Boiler Room set</strong> showcases an{" "}
            <em>80s synth-influenced sound</em> she describes as{" "}
            <em>‘indie dance meets dark disco’</em> — a flickering neon bridge
            between her <strong>New York</strong> roots and{" "}
            <strong>Miami</strong> home.
            <br />
            <br />
            Meanwhile, her long hours spent in the studio reveal a producer
            working within a <strong>melodic techno</strong> sound and a{" "}
            <em>laid-back, heavy, soulful groove</em> that, somehow, fits within
            the same sonic aesthetic.
            <br />
            <br />
            It’s not an accident. Layla has honed her understanding of both
            DJing and production weekly on the very front line, touring the
            world.
